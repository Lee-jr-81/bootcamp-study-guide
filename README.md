# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

Learning any new topic requires a way of internalising the information. I have created this webpage to act as a learning resource i can keep referring back to as and when i learn new things regarding front end development. It gives me, the reader, the ability to quickly find and reference any data i have already learnt.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
Badges

badmath

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
